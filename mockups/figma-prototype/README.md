Make-Race — Figma-style Clickable Prototype

What this is
- A lightweight, local clickable prototype implemented as static HTML/CSS.
- Screens provided: Home, Car Selection, Garage, Track Select, Race HUD, Post-Race.
- Use this to validate flow and asset/layout before building full Figma screens.

How to use
1. Open `mockups/figma-prototype/index.html` in your browser.
2. Click the buttons to move between screens (prototype navigation).

Importing into Figma
- Quick method: open the prototype in your browser, take screenshots of each screen, then in Figma use "File > Place Image" to import screenshots and create frames.
- Better method: if you want editable vector assets, I can export each screen as SVGs (separate files) that you can import directly into Figma; tell me which screens you want as SVGs.

Next steps I can do for you
- Export each screen as individual SVGs ready for import to Figma.
- Produce a full Figma spec (frame sizes, spacing, color tokens, component library) as a .fig or a Figma importable file.
- Generate clickable PNGs optimized for mobile and desktop.

Tell me which option you prefer and I'll continue.
