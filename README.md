# make-race
A game where you make and race cars.

This repo contains source code for my make and race car game. I'm 6 years old and I'm making this with my Daddy.

## The Game

In this game you will make car and then race them.

There will be certain cars for you to pick and then you can customise it.

Once you make your car you will take it to the track and race. If you win you will get money which you can use to upgrade you car or buy an new one.

### Level 1

On a level 1 it will be a straight track kind of like a drag race.

### Level 2

On level 2 there will be jumps on the straight track.

### Level 3

On level 3 there will be slime under the jumps and if you sink in the slime you will need to go back to level 1

### Level 4

If you make it to level 4 you will need to go through rocks and wood.
